## üìù To-Do list

### **Requirements**

#### Structure

- [x] Header with minor navigation _(Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)_
- [x] Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation _(search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)_
- [x] Main section for the font cards
- [x] Font cards which display the Font Name, the sample text, and an add button (the font creator is **not** available via the api, so it is not required in tiers 2 or 3)
- [ ] Back-to-top button that allows users to click and scroll back up to the top _(there could be up to 959 fonts displayed, so you need this!)_
- [ ] Footer section with your developer information

#### Style

- [x] Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
- [ ] Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in the font cards, as the font size is adjustable

#### Functionality

- [x] Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text in each font card
- [x] The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input
- [x] Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
- [ ] Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should reset the page as if the page were reloaded _(do not actually reset the page)_
- [x] On load, the page should display fonts sorted by current popularity, as returned by the Google Fonts Developer API _(see below)_
- [x] The search feature should be fully functional and should display matching fonts (it's up to you if you want to do this via a 'submit' or through onchange)
- [ ] When the search input is cleared (via reset button or manually), the fonts should automaticaly display sorted by popularity again

#### Other

- [x] Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- [ ] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

### **Extras (Not Required)**

- [ ] Make your design fully responsive (small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)
- [ ] Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
- [ ] Implement the change display icon so you can flip between a grid layout and a list layout for the font cards
- [ ] Make the 'add-font' icon add the font to a list (localHost, Cache API, etc) for front-end persistence; users can then delete the font from the list
